# You can export a function in some shells, so that it is exposed to child processes.
# bash -c 'greet' - fails because greet is not defined in the current shell.
# export -f greet - exports the function greet to the current shell.
# bash -c 'greet' - succeeds because greet is now available in the current shell.
